DATABASES

1. RDBMS - Relational Database Mgt system
2. SQL
3. Data mining SQL
4. PostgreSQL/mySQL/msSQL/Oracle
5. 

why learn databases:

worksheets - excel
workbook  - database
worksheet  - tables/relations 
columns - fields
rows - records

1. number of records limitation. excel can store approx. 1 million records.
		mySQL allows for storing large strings of data, approx. 5 billion
2. Avoid redundancy. in a database, a record/row can never appear more than once. Allows for normalization  
3.

**2 types of databases exist:

1. SQL --structured querry language.
		- has high integrity, and the data type is structured
		- used to manipulate a database: Fetch, Insert, Update and delete data
	RDBMS -- any system that uses SQL databases
2. No SQL -- allows for unstructured data.\
			- good for a general data analysis
		
	***Database schema - is a logical representation of your tables ina RDBMS
	
	primary key - it's a field/column in a table that uniquely represents a record.
					e,g. student's registration no., a persons id
				- mostly uses an auto-increament
				- every table must contain a primary key.
	Foreign key - is a field/column used to refer to a record from a parent table. 
				- we usually use the primary key to reference the record.
				
		**Test case
		Case for a bank:
		
		1.CBK --> list of banks --->
		
		2. Equity Bank:
			Branches --> departments --> employees --> 
			Branches --> customers--> accounts
			customers--> contacts
			typeAccount--> accounts
			
		1 NF - ist Normal Form has the most repetition
		2 NF - 2nd Normal Form, has reduced repetition
		3 NF - 3rd NormalForm, has the least repetitions
		
		***RELATIONSHIPS (Records)
		One to many -- one record in the parent table relates to many records in the child
		one to one -- one record in the parent relates/appears to only one record in the child
		many to many -- it's a logical concept, cn never be represented in a real scenerio!!
